# Project introduction
## R coding sample Introduction: This is the coding from a Metric Exercise of the Big Data and Development Course
In this code, I delve into the analysis of a Harvest and Displacement working paper dataset of Afghanistan mobile data and some behavior pattern, and data regarding community trends and agricultural production. We start by exploring the 2021 mobile device data, generating summary statistics and creating at least one informative visual representation. Potential trends to explore include user ping frequency, user drop-off patterns, time-of-day analysis, and behavioral changes around notable dates such as May 1 and August 15. 

Additionally, I draw the maps presented in the paper. The community trends and agricultural dataset includes violence data, provincial and district-level crop calendars, 2021 NDVI, 2020 and 2021 price data, takeover dates, and information on rainfed and irrigated cropland. We produce meaningful visualizations at the 2.5 x 2.5 km grid cell or district level to see 1) Agricultural Production and geographic distribution; 2) Whether Taliban takeover is happening in the harvest season; 3) Wheat production and average wheat price in year 2021
