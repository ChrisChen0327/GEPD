# Python Coding Sample: Analysis of Mobile Data and Agricultural Trends in Afghanistan

## Introduction

This repository contains the analysis code for a Metric Exercise as part of the Big Data and Development Course. The project aims to analyze mobile device data and agricultural trends within Afghanistan, using a dataset that includes information from a Harvest and Displacement working paper. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover patterns in mobile user behavior, community trends, and agricultural production across different regions of Afghanistan during 2021.

## Datasets

The project utilizes several datasets, including:
- **Mobile Device Data (2021):** Tracks user ping frequency, drop-off patterns, and changes in behavior around critical dates (e.g., May 1 and August 15).
- **Agricultural and Community Trends Data:** Incorporates violence data, crop calendars by province and district, NDVI data for 2021, price data for 2020 and 2021, dates of Taliban takeovers, and details on rainfed vs. irrigated croplands.

## Objectives

1. **Mobile Data Analysis:** Explore mobile device data to identify user behavior patterns, focusing on frequency, time-of-day activities, and behavioral changes around significant dates.
2. **Agricultural Trends Analysis:** Analyze agricultural production data and geographic distribution, assess the impact of Taliban takeovers on the harvest season, and explore the relationship between wheat production and wheat prices in 2021.
3. **Visualization:** Generate informative visualizations to represent findings meaningfully, focusing on maps and charts that highlight key trends at the district level or within specific grid cells (2.5 x 2.5 km).

## Methodology

The analysis process is structured as follows:
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and consolidating mobile device and agricultural data sets for the year 2021.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Generating summary statistics to understand the underlying trends in the data.
- **Visualization:** Creating maps and other graphical representations to visualize agricultural production patterns, the timing of Taliban takeovers relative to the harvest season, and the dynamics of wheat production and pricing.
- **Trend Analysis:** Investigating user behavior in mobile data around notable dates and analyzing agricultural trends, including the impact of conflict on agricultural outputs.

## Visual Representations

- Maps illustrating agricultural production and its geographic distribution.
- Analysis of Taliban takeover timing in relation to the harvest season.
- Visuals showing wheat production volumes and average prices throughout 2021.

## Usage

Please refer to the individual scripts for instructions on running the analyses. The code is annotated to guide you through each analysis step and the generation of visualizations.
