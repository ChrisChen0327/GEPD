# STATA coding sample: Analysis of the Influence of the Second Child Policy on Birth Behavior in China

## Overview

This project examines the impact of the Second Child Policy on the birth behavior of females using panel data from the CFPS (China Family Panel Studies) for the years 2010 to 2016. The analysis focuses on identifying changes in birth behavior patterns following the policy's implementation, employing various statistical methods to assess the effects.

## Data

The study utilizes panel data from CFPS for the years 2010 to 2016. The dataset contains detailed demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related variables for the participants.

## Methodology

The analysis employs a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, supplemented by logistic regression models to examine the influence of the Second Child Policy on birth behavior. The study focuses on women of childbearing age, excluding male participants and outliers beyond childbearing age.

### Key Steps:
- **Preparation:** Data cleaning and setting up the environment.
- **Variable Creation:** Generating new variables such as `incremental_children` to capture changes in the number of children post-policy, `policy_supportor` indicating whether the female that have 1st kid actually have a baby after the 2016 policy, and several dummy variables for analytical purposes.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing the data to understand the distribution and central tendencies of key variables.
- **Modeling:** Applying pooled DID methods, fixed effects (FE) models, and logistic regression to estimate the policy's impact on birth behavior.
- **Analysis:** Detailed examination of birth behavior before and after the policy's implementation across various demographics and socioeconomic statuses.

## Code Structure

- **Housekeeping:** Initial setup for data analysis, including setting memory limits and opening a log file.
- **Data Preparation:** Reading and cleaning the dataset to ensure quality analysis.
- **Variable Generation and Data Cleaning:** Dropping irrelevant samples, generating new variables, and setting the panel data structure.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Conducting descriptive statistics, pooled DID analysis, fixed effects modeling, and logistic regression.
- **Results Documentation:** Using `asdoc` and `reg2docx` for exporting results into a user-friendly document.
